Backend
Controller inherits from ControllerBase now
Added Order by Id in GetUsers()

Angular ClientApp
Added Bootstrap
Moved the content from component.html, and splitted content in another component
Used the UserService to manage updating and refreshing users on both components
Used a radiobutton or a select dropdown for the IsAdmin prop, depending on the result of the IsAdminSelection request.
Added form validators

Can still be improved:
--load 'Yes' and 'No' options for IsAdmin prop, from the response data of IsAdminSelection Request
--Services must be inside a Service folder, to keep the project organized 
--In UserController DeleteUser can receive the Id param as the same way as Get
